<section class=art>
<p>Humanity has evolved beyond its initial instinct of survival. We have overcome every obstacle that came in our way. Many of the problems of the past are gone. But progress does not bring only solutions. New problems have risen. Problems we have never faced before, on a much larger scale. Only with our new mechanized companions can we solve them. Robots are a necessity. But like with everything, there are good parts and bad parts when it comes to building better robots. In my opinion, the benefits heavily outweigh the drawbacks. </p>

<p>Robots may have started as tools, but are rising in importance more and more. They are becoming extensions of ourselves, outperforming us in almost every way, except for creativity. If used responsibly, there is nothing they cannot solve. We can say with some degree of certainty that humanity has found its greatest tool yet: a tool meant to completely change our existence. In a few hundred years, robots will do every single tedious and hard task, while we humans will focus on living life to the fullest. Money will no longer be needed, as everyone will have enough of everything. All thanks to the efficiency of robotised labour. Any problem that may surface will disappear before having any chance of affecting us. Their capacity of processing information millions times faster than a human brain means that they will have an extremely quick answer. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as history tells us, humans have the bad habit of turning everything they touch into a weapon. Such was the case with dynamite, which was invented by Alfred Nobel in order to help mining operations. And if we have learned anything from it, it is that history repeats itself. Robots will be used to kill by the wrong men. That does not mean that they are bad. They only obey orders. So, we need not fear them. We are our own worst enemy, and not the weapons we use.</p>

<p>In the end, will they ultimately be our demise? Have we build a bomb that is about to blow up and end us, or are we on the verge of changing our lives for the better, forever? Only time will tell for sure, but for now, one thing is certain: robots are humanityâ€™s ultimate tool and one the most important inventions.</p>
