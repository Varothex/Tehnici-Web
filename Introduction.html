<section class=art>
<p>Since time immemorial, humans have faced many obstacles in their existence: famine, drought, predators, war, extreme weather, diseases and the list goes on and on. The only advantage that we as a species posses compared to other more physically fit animals is our intelligence and creativity. Using our brain we managed to turn rocks into tools and weapons which gave us the means to survive and prosper. Eventually rock turned to bronze, then to iron. Tools gave us the edge. And with time, our tools will continue to get more and more sophisticated.</p>

<p>Humans tend to live life as easily as possible. We as a species want to relax, travel, laugh and not to work or struggle. Our own physical limitations are also a factor in this tendency. We are bound to tire, to fall ill, we need food, water, shelter, we feel pain and we get injured. And those are only the physical aspects. Once upon a time people lived in huts, which did not require any special equipment. But building a stone house only with primitive tools is a tedious work. And as the population grew, so did our needs. So specialised tools for many crafts were invented (the most important ones being the wheel and the plough). Craftsmen sought better and more efficient ways to make pottery, weapons, buildings, ships and carts to satisfy the ever increasing demand. So a solution appeared in the minds of engineers: machines. Machines are complex tools, that are easy to operate and  that compensate our natural weaknesses. One of the most basic machine is the ramp. Using a ramp can significantly ease lifting an object. </p>

<p>What does all of this have to do with robots? When comparing a simple ramp to a modern factory robot, there are no striking similarities. However, they share the same purpose:  helping humans by making different tasks easier or even completing them on their own. Robots are tools. Even though bigger, much more complex, much more expensive and harder to acquire, robots are modern man’s solution to problems. It can do whatever we want it to do, how many times we choose, how often we want and the exact way we want. It doesn’t tire, it doesn’t need sleep, food, love or a reason. It only needs fuel and periodic maintaining.</p>

<p>I chose to write about robots because I think it is important to understand their purpose and importance in a society that is using them ever more: in factories, in the military, in our culture and even in our homes; they are everywhere. They helped us explore places that were unexplored before, produce more food and clothing and they generally make life easier.</p>

<p>By using them, humanity may finally focus on interpersonal relationships, helping others, living and enjoying every moment, rather than worrying about tomorrow.</p>
