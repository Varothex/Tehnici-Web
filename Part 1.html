<section class=art>
<h3 class="headings2"><i>1.1 Definition:</i></h3>

<p>The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots. Everybody has a different idea of what constitutes a robot. Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked "I can't define a robot, but I know one when I see one." Considering all the different machines people call robots, it is nearly impossible to come up with a comprehensive definition. The broadest definition around defines a robot as anything that a lot of people recognize as a robot. There is a general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behaviour, especially behaviour which mimics humans or other animals. </p>

<p>Based on this, a robot is a machine (especially one programmable by a computer) capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. By this definition, robots are distinct from other movable machines, such as cars, because of their computer element. Many new cars do have an onboard computer, but it is only there to make small adjustments. Humans control most elements in the car directly by way of various mechanical devices. Robots are distinct from ordinary computers in their physical nature: normal computers do not have a physical body attached to them.</p>

<h3 class="headings"><i>1.2 Components:</i></h3>

<p>Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature. Essentially, robots are man-made versions of animal life. They are machines that replicate human and animal behaviour. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda’s <abbr title="Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility">ASIMO</abbr> and TOSY’s TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, <abbr title="Unmanned Aerial Vehicle">UAV</abbr> drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. </p>

<p>At present, there are two main types of robots, classified by their specificity of purpose: general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots. A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. All robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards.</p>

<p>A typical robot has a movable physical structure, a motor of some sort, a sensor system, a power supply and a computer “brain” that controls all of these elements.</p>

<p>The vast majority of robots do have several qualities in common. Almost all robots have a movable body. Some only have motorized wheels, and others have dozens of movable segments, typically made of metal or plastic. Like the bones in human bodies, the individual segments are connected together with joints.</p>

<p>Not all robots have sensory systems, and few have the ability to see, hear, smell or taste. The most common robotic sense is the sense of movement: the robot’s ability to monitor its own motion. A standard design uses slotted wheels attached to the robot’s joints. A <abbr title="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> on one side of the wheel shines a beam of light through the slots to a light sensor on the other side of the wheel. When the robot moves a particular joint, the slotted wheel turns. The slots break the light beam as the wheel spins. The light sensor reads the pattern of the flashing light and transmits the data to the computer. The computer can tell exactly how far the joint has swivelled based on this pattern. This is the same basic system used in computer mice.</p>

<p>A typical robotic arm is made up of seven metal segments, joined by six joints. The computer controls the robot by rotating individual step motors connected to each joint (some larger arms use hydraulics or pneumatics). Unlike ordinary motors, step motors move in exact increments. This allows the computer to move the arm very precisely, repeating exactly the same movement over and over again. The robot uses motion sensors to make sure it moves just the right amount.</p>

<p>An industrial robot with six joints closely resembles a human arm: it has the equivalent of a shoulder, an elbow and a wrist. Typically, the shoulder is mounted to a stationary base structure rather than to a movable body. This type of robot has six degrees of freedom, meaning it can pivot in six different ways. A human arm, by comparison, has seven degrees of freedom.</p>

<h3 class="headings"><i>1.3 Applications:</i></h3>

<p>Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% in Australasia and 1% in Africa. 40% of all the robots in the world are in Japan, making Japan the country with the highest number of robots. Japan hopes to have full-scale commercialization of service robots by 2025. Much technological research in Japan is led by Japanese government agencies, particularly the Trade Ministry. </p>

<p>Many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people, even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction. As early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clean parts by removing melding flash;</li>
<li>Spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence;</li>
<li>Pack things in boxes: for example, orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes;</li>
<li>Make electrical cable harness;</li>
<li>Load trucks with boxes (a packing problem);</li>
<li>Handle soft goods, such as garments and shoes;</li>
<li>Shear sheep;</li>
<li>Robotic prosthesis;</li>
<li>Cook fast food and work in other service industries;</li>
<li>Be a household robot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation, finding survivors in unstable ruins, exploring mines and shipwrecks), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive, such as outer space or the bottom of the sea, performing repetitive and dangerous tasks humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations. As mentioned before, robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviours usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. The advent of nanobots, microscopic robots that can be injected into the human body, could revolutionize medicine and human health. </p>

<p>There are robot kits like Lego Mindstorms, BIOLOID, OLLO from ROBOTIS, or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children learn about mathematics, physics, programming, and electronics. Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST LEGO League, Junior FIRST LEGO League, and FIRST Tech Challenge competitions. There have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer, Leachim (1974), and 2-XL (1976), a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on an 8-track tape player, both invented by Michael J. Freeman.</p>

<p>As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots. Robot Operating System is an open-source set of programs being developed at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich, Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms. Microsoft is also developing a "Windows for robots" system with its Robotics Developer Studio, which has been available since 2007. </p>

<p>As robots have become sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behaviour, and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights. One scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019. Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050. Recent advances have made robotic behaviour more sophisticated. The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called Plug & Pray. </p>

<p>For centuries, people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions, although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy. </p>

<p>A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology company Foxconn who, in July 2011, announced a three-year plan to replace workers with more robots. At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three-year period. </p>

<p>Lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws. </p>

<p>Kevin J. Delaney said "Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment." The robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers.</p>

<p>The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 puts forth evidence showing that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance. </p>

<p>Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. There are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that, as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions. One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively. However, other experts question this. One robot in particular, the EATR, has generated public concerns over its fuel source, as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances. Although the engine for the EATR is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors, which it can find on battlefields or other local environments, the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.</p>

<h3 class="headings"><i>1.4 Robotics:</i></h3>

<p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. This field overlaps with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.</p>

<p>Various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One method is evolutionary robotics, in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent "generation" of robots. Another method is developmental robotics, which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other functions. Another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a Smartphone and robot and is named RoboHon. </p>

<p>Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behaviour and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily.</p>
